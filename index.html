                    <p>In all the sports of the world that I could be playing or I could be practicing I ended up with <br>
                    basketball, a common sport for men known for its agility, strength, speed, decision making, field vision and most of all <br>

                    <p>Despite growing up as a kid who plays outside with peers and cousins I fell into a deep pit named <br>
                    video games, discovering video games turned me into an awkward shut in. I enjoy playing RPG/MMORPG namely Inotia 1 to 4,<br>
                Zenonia 1 to 4, Torchlight, Defence of the Ancients, Devil may cry 1 to 5 and many more.</p>

                    <p>Music, yes it is a daily basis for me I think there is no day I'll not listen to music, it's like an auto system in me <br>
                    Im into heavy metal because It just wakes up the primal instincts in me, going all ballistic and crazy, looking at my face <br>
                you'll have a hard time guesing my taste in music.</p>
